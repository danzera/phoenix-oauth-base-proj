<h5>Create New Topic</h5>
<!-- Phoenix has built in helpers to spare us from writing raw HTML forms -->
<!-- opening tag with "%=" is an indication that we will be writing Elixir code directly in our HTML -->
<!-- Below is essentially the same as: form_for(@changeset, resource_path(@conn, :create), fn f -> end) -->
<!-- English translation: create a form with this changeset -->
<!-- 	send the form contents to the :create route on the "resource" path when the form is submitted -->
<!-- 	will eventually end up as an HTML <form> tag -->
<!-- 	the properties provided determine where the form will be submitted and set the associated html properties -->
<!--  the "@" symbols denote variables that are expected to be passed in whenver this template is rendered -->
<%= form_for @changeset, topic_path(@conn, :create), fn f -> %>
	<!-- use more embedded Elixir code to generate our input field and submit button -->
	<div class="form-group">
		<!-- f represents the form -->
		<!-- Elixir will set helper properties on the <input> tag that gets generated -->
		<%= text_input f, :title, placeholder: "Topic Title", class: "form-control" %>
		<%= error_tag f, :title %>
	</div>

	<!-- submit button will say "Save" and have the specified class property -->
	<%= submit "Save", class: "btn btn-primary" %>
<% end %>
